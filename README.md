## Overview
This was my first project using basic HTML & CSS. No CSS framework like Bootstrap was used in this project; nor was any HTML templating framework. This was purely a test of my syntax knowledge.

## My process
Since this was a simple one-pager, I decided to draw out the sections on paper and markup the specific sections I would need. This allowed me to be a bit more proactive when calling out my Classes, versus having to come back to specific sections.
I completed the enitre HTML & CSS of each section before moving on to thr next. This included the mobile-first approach and making sure it was reponsive.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
Above all else, this project tested my knowledge of media queries and importing fonts. I had to use different fonts for different <h1><h2><h3> tags.
This project also tested my knowledge of spans and their use case. There was a lot of text-bolding in this project.

### Continued development
As I continue to become more efficient with my CSS classes, I'd like to come back to this project and improve upon some of these practices.
